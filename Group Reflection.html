                    <h2>Jiaqi li (3798766)</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, we assigned tasks very well and were able to unify opinions through meetings. However, there are still areas that need to be improved as we can hold more meetings and discuss better solutions. What surprises me
                        is that everyone can actively complete their own parts and help each other. What I have learned in the team is that the best solution often requires a combination of everyoneâ€™s ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Xinyu Chen (3798356)</h2>
                    <p>Organizing everyone to complete the project together is a very interesting thing. Although we encountered a lot of difficulties in the process, such as team members' time issues, differences in opinions when working together, and misunderstandings
                        of ideas. But overcoming these problems has made us grow a lot and made us more like a real work team. In general, I am very happy to meet such a group of partners and look forward to the opportunity to work together in the future.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Xiaodan Qiu (3771588)</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, I was working on career plans, roles and risks. I am responsible for comparing the ideal work of team members and finding out the similarities and differences between these jobs. Then I write a role to bring the
                        role of team members into our project, and finally explain what risks our project will have. Then I think I can write more detailed in these fields and improve my understanding of the details of these technology products. I realized
                        that communication and mutual help are very important for teamwork. One person's success is not enough to support a team, and win-win cooperation is the best.</p>
                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Zehua Tong (3563792)</h2>
                    <p>After we finish this assignment, I think I have learned a lot, including new knowledge and new concepts, I am responsible for project planning and process which is really a big work, I also described the development direction of the
                        project. In this process, I build the project step by step by understanding different technologies. Fortunately, I found a lot of very useful techniques and principles which helped me to describe the process and plan of the project
                        smoothly. Through this assignment, I learned more about software development, I also understand that I have a lot to learn about developing software. I think if we can, we could add more professional technology to the assignment
                        and describe the process of the project in more detail. What I find particularly surprising is that we already have such a powerful technology, like laser point cloud technology, it can accurately scan the city's building and road
                        coordinates and can make a three-dimensional 1:1 model in virtual space. And through this group assignment, I clearly understand the importance of communication. After many group discussions, we shared ideas with each other and
                        overcame the difficulties step by step.</p>

                    <h2>Meng Wang (3829532)</h2>
                    <p>I have brought a lot of trouble to you in this teamwork. Because someone in my family died, I had to put my studies aside to deal with things. Thank you all for your help and understanding. When I cannot attend a meeting, people come
                        and tell me what the meeting is about and what the issues are. In the arrangement of work, people will also take the initiative to help me. It is very reassuring to me. A3 let me clearly feel the progress of everyone. We improved
                        on the mistakes we made in A2. And be able to cooperate better. To me, our team is good and there is nothing to improve on. </p>
