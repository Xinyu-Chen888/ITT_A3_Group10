                            <p>My name is XinYu Chen. My email is s3798356@student.rmit.edu.au. I am from the south of China where the climate is hotter than Melbourne, and it is also more humid. Before coming to RMIT for bachelor for IT, I had studied at
                                a Chinese university for two years. Nowadays, everyone needs to use the internet and different application, and that is why I study on this subject—Information Technology. Before coming here, I have a little knowledge of
                                HTML, java, c programming languages, and I hope to come to RMIT to learn more. I usually play pc game and exercise at a fixed time every week.</p>

                    <h2>Group Processes</h2>
                    <p>For Assignment 2, we had several group discussions and decided to use Xinyu’s project idea as a core part of our project idea, and the rest of the members' ideas were attached to it, like Xinyu’s project idea is develop an online travel
                        software and help people can travel online when they stay at home, and we also have Jiaqi’s project idea, he want to create an adventure game when player are playing this game they will feel to be personally on the scene. Then
                        we combine these two project ideas, develop an online travel software and users could the charm of travel through game way. Other members contributed their ideas as well, add special functions to the software. We thought it was
                        a great project idea, we continue to use it in assignment 3. But in the Assignment 3, the project needs to give a lot of detailed information, as if it were really developing the software. We also learned a lot of relevant knowledge
                        during this period so that the details of the project can be described.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Career Plans</h2>
                    <p>There are five people in our group, representing five different ideal jobs: Game Developers, Boss of a software company, Senior programmer, JavaScript game programmer, Demand and Supply Planning Manager. We are all learning information
                        technology, and there is no doubt that our ideal jobs are all related to information technology. But one job is different from the other four, not an information technology-related industry. The similarities in these jobs are all
                        related to developing software. Game developers and game programmers are the same. They both develop games and require skills such as java and c language. Senior programmers are also related to game development, but this position
                        is not to develop games. Unlike game developers, this job develops systems and tools to quickly find performance bottlenecks and suggestions. The software development company includes the above job positions. He mainly wants to
                        do VR and AI, and then game developers also need VR technology. Demand and supply planning manager is different from all of the other job. Demand and supply planning manager are different from all the other jobs, this job is mainly
                        to analyze the data and planning, there is no common with other jobs.
                    </p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Tools</h2>
                    <p><strong>
                        Github Repository</br>
                        AWS Bucket</br>
                        Microsoft Teams
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>The GitHub Repository has always been a very useful tool for completing IT projects. We can share work progress through GitHub. We also use AWS bucket to upload our website. In addition, we edit documents and participate in MT. MS
                        team’s document meeting cooperation function is also very powerful, making our cooperation tasks very transparent and efficient. Although our work progress was somewhat conflicted, the problem was resolved. We used AWS to upload
                        our website.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Project Description
                    </h2>
                    <p>During the pandemic, due to government control, people have to reduce their outing activities. For some people, the difference may not be big, but for more people, they don’t like the depression of staying at home and hope to go out
                        and relax. Recent studies have also shown that this increased anxiety resulting from COVID-19 could be particularly prevalent among people with a history of psychiatric problems. Most people feel depressed, their freedom is restricted,
                        and they rely heavily on relaxation and socializing, so we designed a software to help people alleviate this situation.</p>
                    <p>People have special needs in special times. This travel social application can bring a simulated travel experience to the user’s senses through the device and will not encounter the dangers encountered in real situations. This app
                        supports online face pinching to provide a social image for themselves in the virtual world, and we also encourage users to design and share mods to add fun.</p>
