                    <h2>Aims</h2>
                    <p>This is an online travel software. The reason we want to make this software is that we want to help users travel, make friends and chat at home. During the COVID-19 epidemic, lockdown not only blocked the virus but also greatly affected
                        people's social interaction. People stay at home, it is hard to make new friends, and they cannot see the scenery around. People can only stay at home and use traditional social software to make friends or watch photos outside,
                        but traditional social software cannot meet the real travel simulation, so we have this software. We hope that through this kind of friend-making software that simulates real travel, people will be able to catch up with new friends
                        and enjoy the scenery around them when they are blocked or hard to travel. If we want to implement it, we need to understand a lot of technologies, like 3ds Max, Unity, laser point cloud technology and database technology. And
                        we can use 3ds Max to build simulation roles for users. We must collect a data set which is the data points of each city can be obtained through the shooting of the acquisition vehicle, these data points correspond to the coordinates,
                        height and distribution of buildings in the city(This requires ‘laser point cloud technology’ support). Then we can use these data set to establish a 1:1 3D model in the virtual space just like the Sandbox Game (through Unity).
                        When users can normally use the software to travel online, we need to develop new features or functions to keep old customers and attract new ones, we will be developing some user interaction functions through AR technology. For
                        example, through AR technology, the historical stories and records of current scenic spots are provided for each user in real time. And users can shop in the online stores of merchants, users can view product details through AR
                        technology and our software provide links to each product. In this project, the most important thing is to establish a 1:1 3D model in the virtual space according to data sets we collected. Because this is our main function and
                        selling point, if we want users to travel online through our software, we must meet the needs of customers and let them see the scenery they want to see. If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, we want to
                        collect data sets from all cities which include the coordinates, height and distribution of buildings and roads. If possible, we hope to collect more data sets, such as canyons, mountains, and plains.

                    <!-- Plans and Progress -->
                    <a name="Plans and Progress"></a>
                    <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
                    <h3>what our project will do?</h3>
                    <li>Provide more travel options for users</li>
                    <li>Provide a social platform</li>
                    <li>Let people feel the beauty of travel and socializing even when they stay at home</li>
                    <li>make online travel more meaningful and develop some functions that normal travel does not have (Through some new technologies, make some innovation)</li>
                    <li>If the software is successful, it may make people travel more diverse in the future</li>
                    <p>We have a project plan, and we all know that what we need to do is online travel software, which is an innovative software. We have also conducted investigation and research on this aspect. And then it's about creating software. We
                        need to divide the creation software into two parts – Design software and Development software.</p>
                    <h4>For Design software</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Clear the way of thinking. This process should be a drafting process. In this process, we should have a systematic idea of the app you are currently making. We should have a general direction for the software
                        model we design, including application interface, user interface, software appearance and so on (Balsamiq or Marvel are very suitable for making drafts of models).</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>after we have finalized all the requirements of the demander on the draft, we need to turn the draft into a formal prototype. The prototype needs to be very clear and realistic, because our subsequent design
                        is completely in accordance with this prototype.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>when the first two steps are completed, we need to start the UI design stage of the software. In this step, the first thing we have to do is design the home page, and then we should have a group discussion
                        to confirm the style, color and tone of the whole software design, and discuss how to highlight the function of the software and reflect the difference of the software. If our think there is a better style and design, then we can
                        adjust it in time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong> when we are satisfied with the front page of the software, we can do all the inner pages mentioned in the previous prototype diagram.</p>

                    <h4>For Development software</h4>
                    <p>Through the design of software, we can sort out the function points of the software, design the interaction diagram of the software, and the interface of the software.</br>
                        Design software code structure according to requirements. Start writing code, test cases, etc. This part can be outsourced to the relative company to tell them the design direction and function of the software in detail.</br>
                        Of course, it can't all be outsourced to other companies, because our software ideas for online travel need to be combined with other technologies. They just help us do the specific model and framework of the software.</br>
                        Through specific technology and resources to make online travel function and integrate it into the software for users to use.</br>
                        Finally, user testing should be carried out to check whether there are loopholes in the function step by step.</br>
                    </p>
                    <p>The reason why our group wanted to make this software was that Xinyu Chen thought that during the covid19 epidemic, people are locked in their homes and can't go out. This will severely restrict many outdoor activities, especially
                        travel. Tourism has been hit hard, but that doesn't mean people don't like to travel, it's just limited by the current environment. The tourism market has not shrunk. We think this is a very big business opportunity created in
                        the current environment. So, we want to try to make an online travel software that can attract people who like to travel, help those who are stuck at home but want to travel. And if the software is successfully released, everyone
                        can experience it. Some people who have not tried to travel may also like to travel after experiencing it, which also can expand the tourism market.</p>

                    <h4>1）Combing the requirements --></h4>
                    <p>Combing the requirements are divided into two parts: require collection and require arrangement.</br>
                        <strong> collection</strong></br>
                        Through the investigation of the market and the impact of the current environment, we believe that the tourism industry is suffering a serious blow, and there is also a very considerable market. And because of the current popularity of social software,
                        we feel that we can characterize the application product as online social Travel software. </br>
                        <strong>Require arrangement</strong></br>
                        From the perspective of application, the first thing to be considered is the realizability, that is, the R & D support needed to realize this requirement (large function point), and whether the current system can meet similar functions. We need to determine
                        if we can make the software we want with current technology. Second, we need to consider the rationality of the system design. Discuss whether the function of software design is reasonable, or whether some special design will affect
                        the use of software.</br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>2）design process --></h4>


                    <h4>3）design prototype --></h4>

                    <div class="box alt">
                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/prototype1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/prototype2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>First of all, select the place you want to visit in "Map". You can drag the screen to find the countries in the world. Then after the selection, will jump to the place you choose, you will see the scenery of this place, and other players
                        in this place at the same time, you can communicate with them, and then add friends according to your or the other party's wishes. The added friends can be found in the "Friends" list, and your chat with them will appear in "Chat".
                        Finally, in "Personal" you can manage your own information and get help from users.</p>

                    <h4>4）test --></h4>
                    <p>The test is divided into 3 parts:</br>
                        The first part is the testing of the software. The functional testing ensures that all functions meet expectations and achieve the desired release effect. The first and most basic test is to ensure that the software is free of bugs or errors. Because
                        this is the most basic requirement of the most program.</br>
                        The second part is to test how well it accomplishes the goal. To test whether all its functions meet expectations, whether they meet the original expectations and plans. This is also very important</br>
                        Another part of the test is about user feedback. The user test is described in detail in the test section below.
                    </p>

                    <h4>5）Release --></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Release preparation. Before release, all programs freezed are confirmed and tested by testers; check that all bugs registered in the system have been resolved, or the remaining bugs do not affect the use of the system. If there
                            are serious bugs that are not resolved, they cannot be released.</li>
                        <li>The person in charge of testing compiles and releases product quality reports for quality analysis and summary.</li>
                        <li>The source code and documents are stored in the library. The source code includes database creation scripts, compilation build scripts and all source codes</li>
                        <li>Package the program; mark the source code and document version</li>
                        <li>Fill in the release baseline notice and notify relevant personnel; the manager conducts audit inspections on the release baseline.</li>
                        <li>Upload the package and use the document to the Download site.</li>
                        <li>Write release notes.</li>
                        <li>Formally release the notice, notify the relevant departments of development, testing, marketing, and sales, and attach product release instructions and product introductions.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>And we also understand that our team members cannot think of all the problems that may need to be faced and the parts that need to be improved. We need to reconcile software functionality with user needs. Most users often only use
                        5% of the functions of a software, which is what we can think of, and the remaining 95% are constantly improved after various users put forward their requirements. </p>
                    <p>We tried to create some personas (3-5 personas), which is hypothetical (imaginary) archetype of an actual user, such as we create a user, who is a traveler, and he likes to travel to the world but can only stay at home because of the
                        current epidemic situation. He now wants the government to lift the restrictions and continue his own travel. Or we have a student user, she has just graduated from university and wants to have a graduation trip, because limited
                        to travel, she is very sad. What she hopes now is to give herself a perfect graduation trip. Through these personas, we can understand the needs of users and improve our software functions from their needs.</p>
                    <p>At present, our team has already had a project plan, understood the needs of the industry, also we had a prototype and a clear direction for the function of the software. But we lack technical personnel, even if everyone has to understand
                        the development of software and some of the technologies we are going to use, but this cannot really develop a software.</p>

                    <p>If we were to hand this project to a new team to complete the job, as the project delivery party, we must make clear several problems: demand, target, development process!</br>
                        <strong>Demand (Project requirements)</strong></br>
                        We should present the project requirements and clearly inform the team that will take over the project, because from the whole production cycle of software products, requirements are the design basis of technical scheme and the basis of actual coding,
                        which will be the most important part of software development.</br>
                        <strong>Target (Project objectives)</strong></br>
                        Different teams have different ideas about project objectives, even if they are doing the same project, such as some people's goal is to use the project as long as it can be used without high requirements, while others attach great importance to the project
                        products and want to meet all the needs of users. We should make clear what the project objectives are and unify the project objectives, which plays an important role in the development of the project.</br>
                        <strong>Development process</strong> </br>
                        The production cycle of software can be divided into five parts in chronological order: requirement, design, development, test and delivery. Each link has corresponding work to be completed, and the ideal state is that each link can be carried out clearly
                        and stably, and there is no need to adjusts or modifications. However, many problems will be encountered in the actual development process, which requires both parties to spend more time and deeply participate in the project and
                        try not to affect the progress and quality of the project.</br>
                    </p>
                    <p>If we are the people taking over, we want to know who the software is for, what special features it has, and what role it will play. In this way, we can understand which parts are more important and have the development focus. Then
                        we want to know the technical requirements for developing this software, such as use laser point cloud technology to collect coordinates of buildings on the map. It would be better if they have some ideas that can make software
                        bonus points and makes the software more attractive.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Roles -->
                    <a name="Roles"></a>
                    <h2>Roles</h2>
                    <p>Our software is a game-based dating software. For our project, we have a clear division of labor and corresponding roles. In our five-person team, there are lead developer, designers, programmers, art designers and testers. Our lead
                        developer is Xinyu Chen. He has good leader skills and have good communication skills which can lead our team on the right track. He is responsible for overseeing the work of the software engineer team working on the project, needs
                        to improve the development process of this game and provide technical solutions. Zehua Tong is the designer of the project. Responsible for the conception and design of software rules and structure. He integrated everyone's ideas
                        into one piece of software. He had a very clear concept of our game based social software, and he added everyone's ideas. Jiaqi Li is the programmer of this software, mainly developing games software. He needs to write scripts
                        to develop and maintain advanced command systems for various software tasks. There is also game engine programming, including simulation of physics, collisions, object movement, etc. Then Meng Wang is a tester, and game testers
                        analyze video games to record software defects as part of quality control. Testing is a highly technical field that requires computer expertise and analytical capabilities. She is delicate in mind and has sufficient knowledge of
                        computer knowledge. Xiaodan Qiu is an art designer. She graduated from art school and has painting experience. This character is a visual artist who creates video game art. In our software, 3D simulation technology and digital
                        software are needed to create characters and environments, such as buildings, weapons, and vehicles.</p>

                    <!-- Scope and Limits -->
                    <a name="Scope and Limits"></a>
                    <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
                    <p>There are two scopes for the online travel function, one is the map scope and the other is the material scope. The map of the entire earth is huge and changing weather and uncertain factors are also a problem. Therefore, we need to
                        define the scope of the project and lay the foundation for the phenomenon of `scope creep'. </p>
                    <h4>Limits</h4>
                    <p>You can do many things in the program, but this does not mean that the user can do whatever they want in it. Porn and violent content are not allowed. In order to build a harmonious environment, we hope to bring users a different way
                        of socializing and a relaxing travel process.</p>
                    <h4>Map</h4>
                    <p>The map scope can start from Melbourne. In addition, we will give priority to making virtual 3D models for popular cities and attractions. We make it according to the popularity of each attraction, so that there will be a market for
                        good users. The map scope will get bigger and bigger, from Melbourne to Victoria state, to the whole of Australia or Oceania.</p>
                    <h3>Material </h3>
                    <li><strong> Weather</strong></li>
                    <p>When users enter different areas, they will trigger different environmental impacts, simulating different climates and weather, including heavy rain, drought, desert, and snow. When users enter different areas, they will trigger different
                        environmental impacts, simulating different climates and weather, including heavy rain, drought, desert, and snow. Weather is very important during tourism. It is difficult for people to see the stars on a dark clouded night, and
                        the rainbow is also after wind and rain.</p>
                    <li>Weather limits</li>
                    <p>Climate elements such as sunlight, wind and rain can be simulated, but we can only provide users with some appropriate experience in extreme weather. Our purpose is to help users relax through simulated travel. The adventure function
                        is not available.</p>
                    <li><strong>Pinch face</strong></li>
                    <p>Including all kinds of robots, monsters, cute animals. Users can also upload self-made mods to the community for others to use. Your appearance in the program may be like your business card, you can look cute and beautiful or cool
                        and handsome, you can also look fierce.</p>

                    <p>point cloud is a database containing points in the three-dimensional coordinate system. However, from the typical workflow perspective, the only important thing is, that point cloud is a very accurate digital record of an object or
                        space. It is saved in form of a very large number of points that cover surfaces of a sensed object.（GRZEGORZ CIĘPKA 2016 cite

                    <p>Through computer graphics, we can record the data collected by the collection vehicle as a data format, and store it in the database, and at the same time can call it at any time. This technology is very important for the storage of
                        our image information and the construction of online models.</p>

                    <p>The full name of AR technology is Augmented Reality, which is a very popular and popular new technology in recent years. AR uses multimedia three-dimensional modeling, real-time tracking, intelligent interaction and other means to
                        enable the generated virtual simulation information to interact with information in reality, thereby enhancing reality. This can greatly improve the immersive experience of our social map application.</p>

                    <p>Communication is a profound art. One third of the world's people lose their jobs because they are incompetent, and two thirds because they cannot get along with others successfully. Failure and misunderstanding due to communication
                        can be devastating to the team. The communication mode of Group 10 is very relaxing. In Goup10, there were all Chinese people, so we chose the most iron and Chinese chat software to cooperate with the use of MC Team. So as to prevent
                        members from missing out on important information. Because WeChat is used in conjunction with the MC Team, Group 10 has an excellent Team atmosphere. We talked like friends we had known for a long time. In the discussion of learning,
                        everyone will seriously and actively put forward new ideas and new ideas. Group10 regular team meetings. However, when we encounter difficulties, we will discuss them in group chat and solve them timely. If not, we will organize
                        additional meetings for online discussion, and the meeting time is agreed by everyone. We will use the MC Team's meeting capabilities to assist us such as voice call, video call, screen share and so on. Usually we have a regular
                        meeting every week. If someone does not arrive, we will use the WeChat phone to find out the situation. We also have detailed minutes for the team to read if they need time off. </p>
