                    <h2>Topic</h2>
                    <p>Since December 2019, coronavirus infections began to appear in people around the world. The World Health Organization has warned us to protect ourselves. We need to maintain basic hand and respiratory hygiene, stick to safe eating
                        habits and, if possible, avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing. Based on the situation right now, people have to give as many public activities as they can because
                        of the coronavirus. People started to stay at home. The life without any activities is very boring. Through the Facebook and other social medias, we can see people want to go outside. The willing of going travelling is the highest.
                        The project that we are making is an online travel software. The reason we want to make this software is that we want to help users travel, make friends and chat at home. We hope that through this kind of friend-making software
                        that simulates real travel, people will be able to catch up with new friends and enjoy the scenery around them when they are blocked or hard to travel.
                    </p>
                    <p> want people to feel as real as possible traveling with friends and family through our software. People can still enjoy the meaning of travel with their family and friends, enjoy the scenery, learn about the local history and culture,
                        and take photos with their family and friends. We will also offer recipes for local snacks to help people get together and enjoy the local cuisine.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Motivation </h2>
                    <p>Under the influence of novel Coronavirus, I don't want people to be depressed because they can't travel. That's why we made this app. Most importantly, we want to preserve the meaning of travel. I hope that users can still experience
                        the most local customs, eat local food, and learn about local history and culture. Of course, I also hope to leave photos with my family and friends traveling with the app as a souvenir. The current mainstream of IT lies in the
                        field of new technologies and the development of artificial intelligence. This app will cover these two areas. This app is very malleable. For a future employer, they can improve this app to many different ways. For example, they
                        can develop this app to a tool of a travelling company as this app can show the joy of travel.</p>

                    <h2>Landscape</h2>
                    <p>The main service of our application is online travel, and this application is like Google maps, their streetscape patterns are the inspiration for our application. But the application we designed has more user delivery capabilities
                        than Google Maps' street view model, and use more technologies to improve our services, such as making virtual space, AR technology to display the corresponding information, online chat system and so on.</p>
